=over 4

=item cart

=item checkout

=item checkout_cart

Responsible for displaying and updating the cart in the checkout process.

=item checkout_address

Responsible for displaying and updating the cart in the checkout process

=item checkout_payment

These basetypes have to be children of the checkout basetype. Their order (currently the node modification timestamp) decides the order
they are displayed and processed by the checkout handler.

The checkout handler is an ordinary L<Jet::Engine> class, whereas the other handlers are L<Jet::Shop::Checkout> classes.

=head2 Classes

=over 4

=item Jet::Part::Local::Cart>

Adds the cart and some important urls to the local object.

Note! The cart object defined here is used in all other cart and checkout classes, as well as in the templates. This means that
it's easy to subclass Jet::Part::Local::Cart and define your own cart.

This is quite important, as all quantity price handling and other special stuff easily fits into the whole system.
